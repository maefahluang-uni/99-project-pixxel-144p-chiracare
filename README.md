## Feature
Assignment of NCDs Patients
Nursing Staff Assignment : Nurses are responsible for assigning Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) to patients who require health assessments, focusing on those who lack continuous treatment. This is determined through medical history checks and adherence to scheduled follow-up appointments.
Responsibilities of Village Health Volunteers : Volunteers assigned to the community play a crucial role in overseeing patients allocated to their jurisdiction. Health volunteers in the area have a significant responsibility in on-site monitoring, tracking individuals who lack treatment, and conducting inquiries into the reasons for missed treatments. This information is then provided to the nursing staff for follow-up actions.
Patient Follow-Up and Data Verification
Verification Process for Outpatient Department Staff (OPD) : OPD staff verify patient information, record health examination data, such as blood sugar levels and blood pressure, and document the treatments provided to the patients.
Village Health Volunteer Actions : Village Health Volunteers in the area conduct field visits to patients who have not been examined by OPD staff or those who have missed treatments. They perform basic health check-ups and inquire about the reasons for missing or not receiving treatment.
Reporting and Communication.
Line Notification Form Nursing Staff: In the event of exceeding the health checkup deadline, if a patient does not receive treatment as scheduled, nurses will cross-check the list of patients who missed their appointments and export the list in PDF format. This list is then sent as a notification through the LINE application to the community village health volunteers in the area. This notification serves as an alert for the pending health assessments, streamlining the assessment process, and facilitating the tracking of missed appointment outcomes.
Village Health Volunteers Report : After visiting patients, Village Health Volunteers in the area compile reports summarizing the health status and reasons for missing treatment.
Nursing Staff Review and Action. 
Checking patients missing appointments: Nurses verify information of individuals who miss their scheduled treatments The names will then be exported as a PDF file and then send Line notifications to Village Health Volunteers for NCDs patients who have missed their health check-ups.
Post-Follow-up Actions: Nurses send Line notifications to Village Health Volunteers, who have received reports on the results of the follow-up and reasons for missed appointments. They then contact the patients to reschedule or coordinate with healthcare providers for additional support as needed.
Treatment Monitoring Modules :ChiraCare’s treatment monitoring modules are intricately crafted to meet the nuanced needs of Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) patients. These modules encompass real-time monitoring features, treatment plan adjustments, and proactive alerts for healthcare providers.
Real-time monitoring features ChiraCare provides real-time and continuous monitoring of crucial health indicators for NCD patients. This includes tracking parameters such as blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and other health-related metrics. Healthcare providers can access information regarding the patient's health status, enabling a better understanding of fluctuations or trends in missed appointments.
 Collect treatment information and admission information: Assisting OPD staff, ChiraCare enables the recording of treatment outcomes for NCD patients, such as blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and confirmation of completed treatments. This helps distinguish between patients who attended their appointments and those who did not, ensuring confidence that the treatment aligns with the current health status of the patients.
 Patient follow-up notification for village health volunteers: ChiraCare features a notification system that can link to Line accounts to alert a list of patients who have missed appointments to the community health volunteers. This function notifies the volunteers to conduct on-site follow-ups and inquire about the reasons for missing appointments. This feature enhances the responsiveness of healthcare providers to issues that arise, promoting timely and efficient healthcare delivery.
Efficient Assignment Process.
Health Status-Based Assignment:  ChiraCare facilitates the efficient assignment of non-communicable disease (NCD) patients by allowing nursing staff to categorize and assign patients based on their treatment status. This assignment process ensures confidence that patients will receive comprehensive care and prevents individuals who miss treatment from falling through the healthcare system.
Streamlined Coordination: The system promotes seamless coordination between nursing staff and community health volunteers through a platform that can be linked to Line accounts. This enhances the overall efficiency of the task assignment process, facilitating on-site follow-ups by community health volunteers and tracking their outcomes.
Line Notifications Line Notifications for Overdue Check-ups ChiraCare integrates Line notifications to alert community health volunteers about NCD patients who missed their scheduled health check-ups. This proactive feature ensures that community health volunteers are promptly informed about the need to conduct on-site health check-ups, enabling them to follow up on outcomes in a timely manner.
This collaborative and technology-driven approach ensures that patients with Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) receive continuous monitoring and timely interventions. ChiraCare's integration with Line notifications simplifies communication, enabling healthcare teams to work together seamlessly for improved patient care in the context of NCDs.
 
## Instruction
You need to create skeleton of your project's development. It does not necessary include the complete source code. Please follow instructions below:

- Decide what features to roll out and who is responsible for it.​ Create branches for each feature. Explain each feature in Readme file in their own branch​ 
- Create Docker file for your deployment of your application
